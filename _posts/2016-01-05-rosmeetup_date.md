title: We Have Found a Date for the 2016 Danish ROS Meet-up
---

We have decided on **Thursday February 18th 2016**

We will meet at:
Aalborg University
Section for Automation and Control
Fredrik Bajers Vej 7, C3-203
9220 Aalborg

At ROSCon 2015, a handful of Danish ROS experts met and decided that it was about time that we had a proper Danish ROS Meetup. These experts came from both industry and academia, and both the southern and the northern part of the country.
We want to invite all ROS users to this meetup. Whether you are a user, aficionado or expert, we want you to come. We will share our experiences with ROS and present our different projects that use ROS and hopefully kick-start a useful Danish ROS network.

# Participate
Participation is free, just send an email to kdh@es.aau.dk to let us know that you are coming.

# Call for Presentations
Please consider presenting your work with ROS. This may be anything from a presentation of a project using ROS to a tutorial on a package that you maintain. Please send an email with your topic to kdh@es.aau.dk
