title: ROS Meet-up Denmark
---


At ROSCon 2015, a handful of Danish ROS experts got together and decided that we should have a meet-up. It is going to happen at Aalborg University, and is going to be great! We will share our experiences with ROS and talk about our different projects. As far as I know, this is going to be the first ROS meet-up in Denmark. I hope that this can kick-start a national network of ROS experts in Denmark.

I have made a [Doodle](http://doodle.com/poll/azxwfazaenagh27t) to see if people are interested and if we can find a date in February. If you are interested but can't make it, please fill in the Doodle with the "Can't make it" option.

Everybody interested in ROS is invited to join, but keep in mind that this is not a tutorial on ROS.

I have no idea as to how many we are going to be, so I have not made a program yet. I hope to have at least a couple of talks about our projects and which components of ROS that we use. Aalborg U Robotics will sponsor the event, so there will definitely be coffee and cake etc.
